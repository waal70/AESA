# AESA
All-purpose Encryption and Security Adaptation

This is a project I started to fiddle around with encryption,
trying to get my head 'round the intricacies.

The result is this JAVA project, that will encrypt and decrypt:
* A string that you pass when asked by the program
* A file that you wish to be encrypted
